### 1.1. Purpose and Scope

#### 1.1.1. Purpose

SothebAIs is a system that allows users to socially interact with NFT auctions and follow them in real-time on twitter/X. The social layer for NFTs.

SothebAI's elevates the auction experience by:
- Allowing users to bid on NFT auctions on chain via twitter/X.
- Use of AI agent to manage the auction and interact with viewers in real-time.

#### 1.1.2. Scope

The system will be a collection of services that can be hosted on hardware powerful enough to handle livestreaming. Should be something relatively simple. 

### 1.2. Definitions

#### 1.2.1. Entities

Entities are the main elements and participants in the auction, the characters in the stream and the people behind the auction.
- **Viewer**: A twitter/X account that is watching the livestream.
- **Bidder**: A twitter/X account with an assocated wallet address and at least one bid.
- **Auction Host**: The twitter/X account and associated character that is hosting the auction.
- **Campaign**: A series of regularly scheduled Auctions to sell a collection of art items.
- **Project**: The group behind/associated with the art items to be auctioned.
- **Collection**: The set/collection of art items to be auctioned.
- **Artwork**: A single item from the collection that is being auctioned.
- **Admin**: A user with privileged access to manage auctions, streams, and system configuration.

#### 1.2.2. Standard Terms
- **Wallet**: A cryptocurrency wallet that holds digital assets and is used to place bids.
- **Smart Contract**: Self-executing code on the blockchain that enforces auction rules and handles transactions.
