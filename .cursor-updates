# .cursor-updates

- Analyzed WebSocket/HTTP endpoint configuration, confirmed proper separation of concerns with WS on 4201 and HTTP on 4200.
- Updated Traefik configuration for admin frontend to fix route conflicts and infinite loading issues with proper priorities and middleware.
- Updated Traefik admin frontend routing to use specific Host rule with domain and proper path handling.
- Changed admin frontend container configuration from `expose` to `ports` to enable direct localhost access.
- Enhanced security by updating Clerk middleware to require authentication for all routes except sign-in pages.
- Moved Redis functionality from persistence.ts to redis-service.ts and removed the old file for cleaner Redis access boundaries.
- Updated state system documentation to reflect removal of debounced persistence in favor of immediate Redis saves, added real-time WebSocket broadcasting, and enhanced type validation with comprehensive logging.
- Reorganized project structure: moved types to dedicated types/ directory, consolidated state management files, and added utils/ for shared utilities like logging.
- Updated state manager tests to use new redis-service imports and added stream state mocks to match the current implementation.
- Created detailed streaming implementation plan in `apps/stream-manager/src/streaming/README.md` with architecture, components, and implementation phases for RTMP server, FFmpeg encoder, and stream muxer
- Updated main `README.md` with current implementation status, including completed streaming components and planned features for security and performance
- Updated streaming implementation plan to integrate with Sharp-based rendering pipeline, replacing Canvas with Sharp for frame processing and adding dedicated frame pipeline component
- Reorganized implementation phases to focus on Sharp integration first, followed by FFmpeg encoding and RTMP output
- Added detailed integration example showing composition engine, frame buffer, and streaming pipeline interaction
- Implemented core streaming components:
  - Created RTMP server with Node-Media-Server integration, event handling, and metrics
  - Added Sharp-based frame pipeline for efficient frame processing and memory management
  - Implemented stream muxer with output management, error handling, and reconnection logic
- Updated streaming architecture diagram and documentation to accurately reflect Sharp-based rendering pipeline, frame processing components, and output handling
- Updated implementation status to show completed Sharp integration phase and current progress on FFmpeg and RTMP components
- Added detailed configuration structure for all components including pipeline, encoder, muxer, and RTMP server
- Updated integration example with complete pipeline setup including Sharp frame processing


## 2025-02-10
- Consolidated streaming configuration into main config file, removing duplicate config and standardizing environment variables for all streaming components.
- Removed streaming-specific logger in favor of using the main application logger with streaming-specific logging methods.
- Created comprehensive README.md for the core system, documenting the architecture, components (Composition Engine, Layout Manager, Viewport Manager, Asset Manager), integration patterns, and performance considerations.
- Enhanced core system documentation with improved architecture diagrams showing detailed component relationships, data flow, and component responsibilities.
- Removed outdated config/validation.ts as validation is now handled directly by Zod schema in config/index.ts.
- February 10, 2025: Reorganized testing structure to follow Jest conventions with separate unit, integration and e2e test directories.
- February 10, 2025: Moved development tools to src/tools/debug directory and converted test scripts into proper integration tests.
- February 10, 2025: Fixed streaming and WebSocket integration tests to match actual implementation types and methods, added timeouts and proper cleanup.
